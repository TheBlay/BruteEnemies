Brute Enemies is a simple mod that makes every creature immune to knockback.

My objective is to increase overall combat difficulty, forcing you to dodge,
react and not just swing enemies far away(coughs BATS).

This should be compatible with other mods and even pair well for a good new
challenge and even more difficulty (or maybe just a new experience).
 I would love to see new challenges and series with Brute Enemies,
 if you or know someone who is making one, let me know!
 
Also, don't forget to have fun!
